# Cloudspokes Challenge 1599

Project #6 (out of 49) is my very first submission to a Cloudspokes [challenge](http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenges/1599).

I've published the [source code](https://bitbucket.org/parasquid/cs_1599) on Bitbucket.

Here's hoping I nab the first prize (although I think there's a lot of really good competition out there).

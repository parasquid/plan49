# Hello, World

You're looking at the very first project for Plan49 :) What's Plan49 you say?
Well, you can read all about it in the [Frequently Asked Questions](/faq) page.

June 4 is, incidentally, Week 23 but I want to start counting from 1 so this project is counted as the Week 1 project. Later on we'll just go through the year up until Week 31 then Week 2 of 2013 will be Week 32.

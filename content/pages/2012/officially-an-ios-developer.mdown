# I'm now officially an iOS developer

I've made the leap, and paid RM299 for the privilege of developing for iOS. I've deployed my very first iOS apps onto my iPod Touch (a simple Titanium Appcelerator hello-world app, as well as one of the default XCode project templates).

Three cheers for continuous learning :)

# Caveats when using MongoDB and Linode's Nodebalancers

One of the best-known features of MongoDB is it's being "fast" - bunny quotes because its speed depends on it relaxing a few instances of ACID compliance.

I just got bitten by it this week when debugging why certain records were double-recorded. It turns out, the MongoDB server queues writes if the i/o cannot keep up. This is fine when you only have a single server (and you have a perfect copy of the record to check against when a situation that would cause a double-recording will occur), but when you start putting servers behind a nodebalancer in round-robin fashion you will start getting problems.

Right now I've enabled session stickiness in the nodebalancer so that the same client will be assigned to the same backend server for all of its requests.

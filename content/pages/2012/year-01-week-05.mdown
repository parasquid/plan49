# KL-MUG Presentation on MapReduce

Project #5 (out of 49) is a presentation at Kuala Lumpur Mongo User Group on about [Map Reduce](/presentations/klmug-mapreduce).

It was an interesting presentation, as I myself still have a lot to wrap my mind about blocks and closures and functional programming. I think I did very well though, and I came out much more knowledgeable about the paradigm. Teaching someone gives you a great chance to understand the subject matter in and out :)
